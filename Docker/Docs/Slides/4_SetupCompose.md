### Slide 4: Setting Up Infrastructure with Docker

**Title:** Streamlining Infrastructure Setup Using Docker

**Content:**

- **Introduction to Docker Containers:**
    - Explain what a Docker container is: a portable and isolated environment where a piece of software can run. This ensures the software runs the same way on any machine.

- **Example: Setting Up Redis with Docker:**
    - Walk through the simple steps of setting up a Redis database using Docker. Explain how Docker ensures that Redis can be installed and run consistently on any system without the usual installation complexities.

- **Command Explanation:**
    - Show the basic Docker command to pull the Redis image and run it in a container:
      ```bash
      docker run --name my-redis -d redis
      ```
    - Explain each part of the command (`run`, `--name`, `-d`, and `redis`).

- **Benefits of Using Docker:**
    - **Simplicity:** Setting up a service like Redis requires only one command.
    - **Consistency:** The Redis version and setup will be the same on every developer's machine.
    - **Isolation:** Redis runs in its own isolated environment, avoiding conflicts with other software on the machine.

**Visual Aid:**
- Include a simple diagram showing a computer with Docker installed and a Redis container running inside it.

**Slide 4: Streamlining Infrastructure Setup Using Docker**

"As we explore the practical applications of Docker, let's focus on how it can simplify setting up essential software infrastructure. Today, we'll look at a common scenario: setting up a Redis database, which is often used as a fast, in-memory data store for applications.

First, what is a Docker container? It's like a small, self-contained computer system that has everything it needs to run a specific software application. This container ensures that the software behaves exactly the same way, no matter where or on what machine it runs.

Let's consider setting up Redis. Normally, installing Redis might involve downloading the software, configuring it on your system, and making sure it doesn’t interfere with other installed software. With Docker, this process is much simpler.

Here’s the command to start a Redis server using Docker:
```bash
docker run --name my-redis -d redis
```
Let’s break this down:
- `docker run` starts a new container.
- `--name my-redis` gives a name to our container, making it easier to refer to.
- `-d` tells Docker to run the container in the background.
- `redis` specifies which image to use—here, we're using the official Redis image from Docker Hub.

By running this command, Docker will download the Redis image if it’s not already available on your machine, and start a Redis server in a container. This container is completely isolated from other software on your system, ensuring no conflicts or issues.

The benefits here are clear:
- **Simplicity:** You just saw how a single command sets up Redis, ready to use.
- **Consistency:** Every developer who runs this command gets the exact same Redis setup.
- **Isolation:** The Redis server runs in its own space, without impacting other applications.

This example shows how Docker can make managing development environments far less complicated, allowing developers to focus on their code rather than on configuring their tools."

Also lets add one more example of creating sql server image and running it with volume attached:
```bash
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Qwerty1$" -p 1433:1433 -v sqlvolume:/var/opt/mssql --name testSql mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
```
